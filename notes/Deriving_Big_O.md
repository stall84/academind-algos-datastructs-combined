#### Determine Time Complexity

- Define the function
- Find the _fastest growing term_
- Remove the coeffieicient

#### O(1) Constant Time

- Constant Time Complexity
- _Most efficient_ in most applications since only a single (extrapolated/coefficients removed) expression in evaluated

#### O(n) Linear Time

- Linear time complexity.
- Common in algorithms that might have a for-loop .. that loop will be required to run for _n_ number of times

#### O(log n) Logarithmic Time

- Curve will start out steep, but flatten its slope over time.

#### O(n^2) Quadratic Time

- One of the least efficient.
- Classic example: Nested for-loops

#### O (2^n) Exponential Time

- Least Efficient
